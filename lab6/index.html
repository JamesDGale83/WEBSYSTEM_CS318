                <p>Electricity is generated by converting other forms of energy, like heat, wind, or sunlight, into electrical energy,
                    most commonly by rotating a generator. Common methods include thermal power (burning fossil fuels, biomass, or
                    using nuclear fission), hydropower (using moving water), wind power (using wind), solar power (using sunlight), 
                    geothermal energy (using Earth's heat), and tidal power (using ocean tides). Less common are methods like chemical
                    reactions (batteries), friction, heat at a junction of dissimilar metals, light, pressure, and magnetism

                <h3>Methods Using Turbines and Generators</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thermal Power Plants: Burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil) or biomass creates heat, producing steam that turns a turbine.</li>
                    <li>Nuclear Power Plants: Nuclear fission generates heat, which boils water to create steam to turn a turbine.</li>
                    <li>Geothermal Power: Natural heat from within the Earth produces steam to drive a turbine. </li>
                    <li>Hydroelectric Dams: The force of flowing water from dams directly turns the turbine blades.</li>
                    <li>Wind Farms: Wind turns the blades of large turbines, generating electricity.</li>
                    <li>Tidal Power: The movement of ocean tides drives turbines to generate power. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contain1">
                <h3>Methods Using Direct Conversion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Panels: Solar panels use semiconductors to directly convert sunlight into electricity without moving parts.</li>
                    <li>Batteries: Chemical reactions within a battery produce electricity. </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="contain1">
                <h3>Other Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Friction: Generating electricity by rubbing two materials together. </li>
                    <li>Heat: Creating a voltage by heating the junction where two different metals meet (the Seebeck effect). </li>
                    <li>Pressure: Applying pressure to specific crystals can generate electricity (the piezoelectric effect).</li>
                    <li>Magnetism: An electric current is produced when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field. </li>
